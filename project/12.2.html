        Title: Investigating the Factors Affecting the Electrical Resistance of a Wire
        Objective: To explore and analyze the factors that influence the electrical resistance of a wire and understand the relationship between resistance, length, cross-sectional area, and material.
        
        Materials:
        1. Various wires of different materials (e.g., copper, nichrome, constantan)
        2. Power supply (e.g., battery or power source)
        3. Ammeter to measure current
        4. Voltmeter to measure voltage
        5. Rheostat or variable resistor
        6. Connecting wires
        7. Crocodile clips
        8. Meter ruler or measuring tape
        9. Wire cutters
        10. Safety goggles (to protect your eyes)
        11. Notebook and pen for recording observations
        
        
        Procedure:
        1. Put on your safety goggles to ensure eye protection during the project.
        2. Set up a circuit by connecting the wire, power supply, ammeter, and voltmeter in series.
        3. Start with a specific wire and measure its length using a meter ruler or measuring tape.
        4. Connect the wire to the circuit and ensure that the current and voltage are within a safe range.
        5. Measure and record the current (I) and voltage (V) across the wire.
        6. Calculate the resistance (R) using Ohm's law (R = V/I).
        7. Repeat steps 3-6 for the same wire, varying its length while keeping the cross-sectional area constant.
        8. Repeat steps 3-6 for different wires of the same length but with different materials.
        9. Analyze your data, comparing the resistance values for different wire lengths and materials.
        10. Graph your results, with resistance (R) on the y-axis and length (L) or material on the x-axis.
        11. Draw conclusions based on your observations and data analysis, explaining the relationship between resistance, length, cross-sectional area, and material.
        Note: Take precautions when handling electrical equipment and ensure proper connections to avoid short circuits or accidents. Follow any safety guidelines provided by your teacher or school.
        Remember to document your project, including methodology, observations, data analysis, and conclusions, in your notebook.
